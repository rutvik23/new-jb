# Communities Red Hat contributes to 


We ensure community health for Red Hat-sponsored and stewarded projects with active and participatory involvement that can include infrastructure, project management, communications, outreach, and onboarding


#### Software communities


- We're a proud contributor to all aspects of the software stack, from the operating system and developer toolchain to middleware, desktop, and cloud. 


- In addition, Red Hat financially supports a number of open source organizations who help us create and maintain better open source software.


#### Standards communities


- We contribute to a wide range of open standardization efforts that define future interoperable technologies, both in software and hardware. 


- Learn more about the standards and industry bodies in which we are active.
