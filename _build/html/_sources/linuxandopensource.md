# Linux and open source


- Linux is a free, open source operating system (OS), released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). 


- The Linux operating system was created as an alternative, free, open source version of the MINIX operating system, which was itself based on the principles and design of Unix.


- Because Linux is released under an open source license, which prevents restrictions on the use of the software, anyone can run, study, modify, and redistribute the source code, or even sell copies of their modified code, as long as they do so under the same license.


- Linux has become the largest open sources software project in the world. 


- Professional and hobbyist programmers from around the world contribute to the Linux kernel, adding features, finding and fixing bugs and security flaws, and providing new ideasâ€”all while sharing their contributions back to the community.
