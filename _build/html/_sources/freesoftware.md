# What is free software?

- “Free software” means software that respects users' freedom and community. 
- Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. - Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price. 
- To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer.” 
- We sometimes call it “libre software,” borrowing the French or Spanish word for “free” as in freedom.
- When users don't control the program, we call it a “nonfree” or “proprietary” program.
