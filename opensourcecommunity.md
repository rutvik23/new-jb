# What is an open source community?


- Group of individuals who (often voluntarily) work together to develop, test, or modify open source software products.


- Open source communities are semi-organised collections of contributors to a project, typically software. 


- These communities bring people with shared interests together to collaboratively build something, which can be shared with anyone inside or outside of the community. 


- And, almost always, open source projects are the results of distributed communities.
