# What is open source software?


Open source software is released through a specific kind of license that makes its source code legally available to end-users. There are many such licenses, but typically software is considered open source if:


- **It is available in source code form without additional cost**, meaning users can view the code that comprises the software and make any kind of changes to it they want.


- **The source code can be repurposed into other new software**, meaning anyone can take the source code and distribute their own program from it.
