# How does Red Hat contributes? 

- **Participate:** Red Hat participates in and creates community powered upstream projects. We contribute code, collaborate on content, steward projects, mentor leaders, and sponsor events.


- **Integrate:** Red Hat integrates multiple upstream projects, fostering open source community platforms. And we work in multi-organizational projects, bringing industry-recognized standard technologies into our own projects.


- **Stabilize:** Red Hat commercializes these platforms and projects together with a rich ecosystem of services and certifications, while continuing to contribute back to the upstream projects of which we are a part.
